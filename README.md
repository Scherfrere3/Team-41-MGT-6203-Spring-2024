# Team-41-MGT-6203-Spring-2024
Team 41's group project GitHub repository for MGT 6203 (Canvas) Spring of 2024 semester.

This GitHub repository contains the code and analysis for a project that investigates the factors influencing Airbnb prices in New York City using linear regression models. 
The primary focus is on neighborhood groups and room types, with additional variables like minimum nights, number of reviews, and availability days considered. The repository includes R scripts for data 
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and diagnostic testing to ensure the robustness of the models (checking assumptions such as linearity, homoscedasticity, and absence of 
multicollinearity). Results from the models are documented, revealing significant predictors and their impacts on pricing. This project serves as a practical application of statistical analysis in real estate 
pricing, providing insights valuable for hosts, policymakers, and researchers interested in the dynamics of 
the short-term rental market.

In the data folder, there is the listings.csv data we used. In the code folder, there are all the code files we used for this project.
